# OpenRZ67 for Android
This is an Android app for controlling the [openrz67-trigger](https://github.com/mhellevang/openrz67-trigger) bluetooth remote trigger for the Mamiya RZ67 camera.

## Status:
The app works as intended for my use case, but I'm sure there are lots of improvements to be made or bugs to be ironed out. Pull requests welcome.

## Features:
- Automatically connects to the openrz67-trigger, and re-connects if connection is broken
- Trigger the camera using the shutter button
- Trigger a delayed trigger with a user specified countdown
- Trigger bulb mode (requires the camera to be set to bulb).

## Installation:
Check out [releases](https://github.com/mhellevang/openrz67-android/releases/), or clone the repo and build it yourself.
